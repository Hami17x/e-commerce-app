# E-COMMERCE APP

Full stack e-commerce app with Flutter, Javascript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.
In this project, i build the E-COMMERCE APP from scratch and create a cross platform app that works on Android and iOS.

What I have done:

1.Creating REST APIs

2.Store data in MongoDB

3.Using REST APIs with Flutter & Dart, use the Flutter State Management tool as a provider.
